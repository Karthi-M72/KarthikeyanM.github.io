# Flight Accident Analysis – A Data-Driven Story Using Power BI

**Dataset Credit**: Flight accident data sourced from Kaggle

## Objective

To understand how real-world aviation crash data can reveal patterns that help improve flight safety. This project explores, cleans, and visualizes historical flight accident records using **Power BI**.

---

## Key Insights from the Dashboard

- Over **65%** of aircraft involved in accidents had an average lifespan of **20+ years** at the time of crash.
- A small group of **operators accounted for a majority of total fatalities**.
- Most fatal crashes resulted in **complete aircraft loss**, highlighting the severity and low chance of recovery.

---

## Recommended Actions

- Prioritize **audits and upgrades** for high-risk aircraft models.
- Enforce stricter **safety compliance** for frequently involved operators.
- Use **trend and location data** to proactively monitor high-risk regions.

---

## What I Worked On

- Started with raw, messy flight accident data from **Kaggle**
- Cleaned inconsistent entries like `"1+2"` by parsing and converting them into numeric values
- Standardized **date formats**
- Grouped **fatalities into bins**
- Removed **~50% duplicated records**
- Structured the dataset for **visualization**

---

## Dashboard Features (Power BI)

- Slicers for **year**, **aircraft type**, **operator**, and **region**
- Interactive **charts, maps**, and **tables**
- Visual summaries by:
  - Operator  
  - Damage level  
  - Aircraft type  
  - Fatality ranges

## Impact

This project strengthened my **data cleaning** and **data storytelling** skills. It reminded me that **clean data isn’t just about numbers**—it’s about lives, decisions, and the insights we extract to make better choices.
