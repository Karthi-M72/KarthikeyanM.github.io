# 📞 Customer Churn Prediction – Machine Learning Project

**Dataset Credit:** Customer Churn Dataset (~4,617 rows × 21 columns, mix of categorical & numerical features)

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to build a Machine Learning model that predicts the probability of a customer **churning (leaving the company)**.

This addresses key business challenges:

* Retain **at-risk customers** before they switch to competitors.
* Reduce **revenue loss** caused by churn.
* Personalize engagement to improve **customer satisfaction & loyalty**.

## 📊 Model Performance

* **Best Performing Model:** **XGBoost (XGBClassifier)**
* **Accuracy Achieved:** \~97.54%
* XGBoost outperformed other models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM in both accuracy and recall.

---

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

### 🔹 Data Preprocessing

* Cleaned missing values.
* Encoded categorical variables using **One-Hot Encoding**.
* Scaled numerical features for uniformity.
* Balanced imbalanced churn classes.

### 🔹 Model Training

* Algorithms tested: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost.
* Hyperparameter tuning applied for performance optimization.

### 🔹 Model Evaluation

* Compared models using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**.
* **XGBoost** achieved the **highest performance (97.5%)**.
