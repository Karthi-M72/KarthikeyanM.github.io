## Objective

To predict whether a patient is likely to have a liver disease based on clinical and demographic data. This project uses Machine Learning techniques to identify key medical factors that contribute to liver-related health risks.

---

## Key Insights from the Analysis

* Patients with high Bilirubin levels showed a significantly higher probability of liver disease.
* Alkaline Phosphotase and Albumin/Globulin Ratio emerged as strong predictors.
* Age and Gender also influenced patterns, with older patients showing increased prevalence.

---

## Recommended Actions

* Encourage early screening for patients with abnormal Bilirubin and Protein levels.
* Develop risk-based monitoring programs for older age groups.
* Using predictive models to assist doctors in decision-making and timely diagnosis.

## What I Worked On

* Started with raw clinical dataset with mixed data types
* Performed data cleaning and preprocessing:

  * Handled missing values
  * Encoded categorical variables (e.g., Gender)
  * Normalized numeric features
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Built and compared multiple Machine Learning models:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
  * Support Vector Machine
  * XGBoost
* Evaluated performance with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

---

## Model Performance

* Best performing model: **The Random Forest model achieved the accuracy at approximately 70% (0.7063).**
* Highlighted most influential features: Bilirubin, Alkaline Phosphotase, Albumin/Globulin Ratio.

## Impact

This project strengthened my data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation skills.
It also emphasized how data-driven healthcare insights can support early detection and better treatment strategies for critical conditions like liver disease.
